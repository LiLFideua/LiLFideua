# Hi there, I'm Lucas Tarragó 👋

### 🚀 Engineering Physicist | Space Systems M.Sc. Student

I am an **Engineering Physics graduate** and current **M.Sc. student in Space Systems** based in **Valencia, Spain**. My work bridges the gap between abstract theoretical physics and robust engineering implementation.

Currently, I am focused on the intersection of **Quantum Information**, **Photonics**, and **Aerospace Electronics**, aiming to design instrumentation capable of withstanding extreme environments—from quantum decoherence to the vacuum of space.
